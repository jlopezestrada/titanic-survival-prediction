# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic. The model is trained on a dataset that includes various features such as age, sex, and ticket class. The goal of this project is to explore the factors that contributed to survival on the Titanic and to build a model that can accurately predict survival outcomes.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers on the Titanic such as age, sex, ticket class, and whether or not they survived. The dataset can be found in the `data` folder of this repository.

## Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have Python 3 installed as well as the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using `pip` by running the following command:

```pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn```


## Notebooks

There are several Jupyter notebooks included in this repository:


## Usage

To use the trained model to make predictions on new data, you can run the `predict.py` script included in this repository. The script takes a CSV file as input, where each row represents a passenger and the columns correspond to the features used to train the model. The script outputs a CSV file with the predicted survival outcomes for each passenger.

To run the script, you can use the following command:


## Conclusion

The Titanic survival prediction model built in this project achieved an accuracy of XX%. The model can be used to explore the factors that contributed to survival on the Titanic and to predict the likelihood of survival for new passengers based on their features.
